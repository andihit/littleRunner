The turtle is a complex thing:


Turtle is walking
"""""""""""""""""

* Jump on it: it will furl (sleeping) and wake up after a certain time
* Walk to it: you 'll :ref:`loose one livepoint <looselivepoint>`.


Turtle is sleeping (furl)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Jump on it: getting crazy (run very fast in one direction, and if there is a object, change direction and run back)
* Walk to it: getting crazy (start direction: the direction you are walking when you touch the turtle)


Turtle is crazy
"""""""""""""""

* Jump on it: the turtle sleeps again
* The turtle catches you: you 'll :ref:`loose one livepoint <looselivepoint>`.

If you walk in the gumba / the gumba walks to you, you :ref:`loose one livepoint <looselivepoint>`.

When you jump at the gumba, the gumba is dead.


Spika

When you jump in it/walk in it, you :ref:`loose one livepoint <looselivepoint>`.
The color of the spika doesn't matter.
